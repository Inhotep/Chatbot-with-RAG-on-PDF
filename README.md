📌 Project Overview:

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbot that enhances traditional causal language models by enabling them to retrieve relevant information from user-provided PDFs. This ensures that the chatbot generates highly context-aware, factual, and dynamic responses tailored to the user's specific documents.

🔍 Key Features:

✅ Document-Aware Responses – The chatbot processes user-uploaded PDFs and answers queries based on the extracted content.

✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Enhances the LLM’s responses by fetching relevant document chunks from a vector database.

✅ Efficient Memory Usage – Uses 4-bit quantization (BitsAndBytes) to enable efficient inference on limited hardware.

✅ Customizable Knowledge Base – Users can provide new PDFs dynamically, expanding the chatbot’s knowledge instantly.

✅ Domain-Specific Adaptability – Works well for legal, financial, research, and technical documentation.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

🔹 LLM – Causal Language Model (Zephyr 7B Beta from Huggingface)

🔹 RAG Pipeline – Vector store-backed retrieval using Pinecone

🔹 PDF Processing – PyMuPDF for text extraction

🔹 Model Optimization – BitsAndBytes for efficient execution

🔹 Frameworks – LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers



🎯 Use Cases:

🔸 AI-powered document-based Q&A (research, corporate knowledge bases)

🔸 Legal & Financial AI Assistants (retrieves insights from contracts, policies)

🔸 Enterprise Chatbots with private document integration

🔸 Academic & Research AI (summarizing research papers, generating insights)
